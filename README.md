# Welcome
This is my repository for experimenting with JavaScript before I embark on the mission of creating a whole new project.

## What does that mean?
Currently I am studying JavaScript and I will be trying to see how this particular programming language actually interacts with the other two web languages HTML and CSS.

I will be using this repository and maybe many more to experiment with features.

Then after I find my feet with it I will be designing a project for my second submission with Code Institute.
